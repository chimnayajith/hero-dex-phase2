# HERO-DEX

The nefarious villain, Dr.Dulldev, has unleashed a wave of confusion upon the world. People are struggling to remember even the most basic details of their favourite heroes! Can you help?

Build a user-friendly superhero encyclopaedia app with Flutter and vanquish Dr.Dulldev’s schemes forever! This powerful framework by Google allows you to create beautiful and functional mobile applications for both Android and iOS.

## Here's your mission breakdown:

- **Craft a Sleek Interface** : Design a user-friendly layout that allows heroes to be easily browsed.(Feel free to get creative and explore Flutter's rich set of widgets to achieve this.
  )
- **Unleash the Power of Search** : Implement a lightning-fast search bar so users can find their favorite heroes in a flash.
- **Reveal the Hero Within**: Create detailed hero profiles packed with information like superpowers, weaknesses (don't worry, these are their secrets!), and even captivating images. Flutter offers various widgets for text, image display, and layout. You can leverage these or explore additional packages for specific functionalities.
- **Favorite Heroes Tab**: In the midst of chaos, users can mark their favorite heroes for quick access. These favorites stand as beacons of hope and clarity, immune to Dr.Dulldev's waves.
- **Dynamic Filtering by Hero Type**: To navigate the murky waters of hero alliances, implement dynamic filtering based on whether heroes are classified as heroes, villains or anti-heroes. Users can filter heroes into these three categories, helping them discern friend from foe amidst the confusion.


**Important Note:** In order to potentially access and display hero images or other online resources, your app might require internet permission.


**Don't be afraid to push the boundaries!**

While these are some core features, feel free to unleash your creativity and add functionalities that make your app truly unique. Remember, the fate of superhero knowledge rests in your hands!
